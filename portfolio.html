    <p style="font-size:200%;"><somethingnew>This is my group's project for 1.1.9. We call our project "Tic Tac Turtle". This game is just like the original Tic Tac Toe, but with a twist. Players 1 and 2 are allowed to change the color of their turtle, which is used in replacement of an "X" and an "O". The game rules the exact same, however we implemented a starting screen and a feature where players have to input a coordinate for the column and the row in order to place their turtles.</p></somethingnew>

    <p style="font-size:200%;"><somethingnew>This is my group's project for 1.2.5. We call our project "Rock Paper Scissors". This game is just like the original Rock Paper Scissors, but we implemented the feature of adding images of rock, paper, and scissors onto the screen. When the player runs the code, the program asks the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors. Once the player types their choice in the console, a computer randomly picks one of the three choices. Depending on the player’s choice and the computer’s choice, the game results in a win, loss, or tie. The program asks the player if they would like to play again. If not, the program stops.</p></somethingnew>

    <p style="font-size:200%;"><somethingnew>This is my group's Scratch project called "T-Rex Runner". This game is just like the original T-Rex Runner, but we added a different sprite instead of the typical pixelated dinosaur. The objective of this game is to make the dinosaur jump over the obstacles by pressing space. The score adds up as you survive longer. However, if the dinosaur hits the cacti, you lose.</p></somethingnew>

    <p style="font-size:200%;"><somethingnew>We first tried to match which data represented sound, movement, light, and temperature. Then, we processed this data by using the process of elimination. We thought this was the most efficient way to accurately match the data correctly because it would eliminate any outliers. Then, we discussed which regions would not be possible with the given information, whether or not we guessed correctly on which graphs represent which data. From there, we sketched the data for each type of data that includes every region. With this information, we came to the conclusion that the robot is in Marsh Lands.</p></somethingnew>

    <p style="font-size:200%;"><somethingnew>These are our graphs that display the total honey production over time for each of the states. In 1997, there was a plenty amount of honey before the honey production started to decrease rapidly in the following years. A few of the states were still very high in honey production, but most of the states decreased tremendously. From 2002 to 2017, the honey proudction rate stayed fairly similar.</p></somethingnew>

    <img src="images/french revolution.jpg" style="width:1600px;height:1199px;">
    <p style="font-size:200%;"><somethingnew>Our project revolves around the concept of a rebellion. The simulation displays a group of citizens. The color of the innocent citizens change if they are affected by the rebellion either being a leader or follower. Then the color changes once more if the “criminal” is put in jail. This relates to revolutions that we have seen in history. One example is the French Revolution and how influencers/ party leaders in society changed the views and opinions of the innocent citizens which sparked change after receiving the government’s support. Many rebellions made history and heavily impacted countries.</p></somethingnew>
