    <p style="font-size:200%;"><somethingnew>This is my group's project for 1.1.9. We call our project "Tic Tac Turtle". This game is just like the original Tic Tac Toe, but with a twist. Players 1 and 2 are allowed to change the color of their turtle, which is used in replacement of an "X" and an "O". The game rules the exact same, however we implemented a starting screen and a feature where players have to input a coordinate for the column and the row in order to place their turtles.</p></somethingnew>
